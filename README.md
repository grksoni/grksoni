# 👋 Hi, I'm Rahul Soni  

🚀 **Software Engineer | C/C++ & Python Developer | Deep Learning **

### 🧠 About Me  
I write code that makes machines think — and I enjoy every bug, breakpoint, and “Aha!” moment along the way.  From building scalable C++ systems to teaching neural nets how to see the world, I live at the crossroads of **software engineering and AI**.  

I love clean architecture, fast execution, and elegant algorithms. Whether it’s optimizing a C++ pipeline, training a CNN at 2 AM, or debugging something that worked “yesterday,” I’m all in.  

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me deep-diving into design patterns, experimenting with new frameworks, or solving way too many problems on LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks.

### 💼 Experience  
**Software Engineer (Post Graduate Engineer Trainee) – Mercedes-Benz R&D India**  
*Aug 2023 – Sept 2025 | Bengaluru, India*  
🚗 Supercharged autonomous driving simulations with **YOLO, DETR & Faster R-CNN** in **CARLA**, teaching virtual cars to drive better than me.  

🛣️ Led development of the **Automated Lane Change (ALC)** module in a production-grade **ADAS** system as Module Owner, coding real-time **C/C++** under tight automotive deadlines.  

⚡ Built high-performance **C/C++ components** for sensor fusion and decision-making pipelines, fully compliant with **safety-critical automotive standards**.  

🏎️ Turbocharged lane and object detection algorithms for **low-latency inference**, improving system precision through rigorous testing and profiling.  

🔍 Applied **OCR with VLM, OpenCV & Tesseract** to detect and interpret part labels in automotive diagrams, bridging AI with practical engineering tasks.  

💻 Added **57,000+ lines of production C/C++ code** (and removed a fair share of bugs too 🙈).  

🚘 Contributed to one of the **most competitive ADAS marketplace projects in China**.  

🛠 Became fluent in a toolbox of dev essentials: **Git, Confluence, Jira, VS Code, Jenkins, PRQA, Bitbucket, GTest, HCGC, and HIS Analysis** 

📊 Built an internal analytics dashboard with **Flask, SQLite, and Pandas** to visualize test data and debug production C/C++ modules.  

🤝 Mentored junior developers, conducted code reviews, enforced modular architecture, and shared countless laughs (and adrenaline-pumping hotfix moments).  

🏆 Honored with the **Outstanding Contribution Award**; our project won the **Highest Impact Innovation Award**.
